<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>I have been programming my whole life, though for most of it I didn't realise I was, simply because
I didn't understand what the term meant. However, these past five years I have been working extra hard
to hone my experience and have be able to create multiple wonderful projects. Below are just a few!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mingle App: Last year my friends and I made a Mingle App for those that are looking to find friends. 
    The UI was designed off the UI of Mutual, and we even had our own swipping algorithm. The main difference 
    however was that the users were on there just to find friends and could be post events if they are looking 
    for someone to come with them and/or wanted to invite more people to join in on the fun!</li>
    <li>whenisbest: Last year my friends and I also wanted to try our hand in recreating the 'whenisgood' website 
    with increased features, newer design, and further integration without the use of so many links that the user would 
    have to keep track of. This project was fun because we were able to learn a lot of things about integration across 
    multiple platforms, but we didn't make it too far along before we lost interest haha</li>
    <li>MyCHIPS: I also just finished my software emphasis capstone and made an app for our client who is looking to 
    basically create the next bitcocin. This process was hard because we needed to learn a lot about his methodology 
    since he didn't use a block chain, so he could acheive true decentralization. However, once we got the concepts down 
    we were able to make him a state of the art app with real time money management systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work">Work Experience</h2>
<p>I have been working non stop for the past five years at a wide array of jobs, but only a few of them have been 
in an actual CS capacity. I think the main reason I was so late in entering the field of my study was simply due to
imposture syndrome. I never really thought I was good enough to be hired by anyone to do things that I considered super 
important, so I didn't bother. Only after facing and overcoming my fears have I been able to eventually get to where I am now!</p>
